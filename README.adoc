Association of open source developers who supporting 7 paradigms:

1) each part of the infrastructure around the technology that accelerates development many times - also individually accelerates development several times

2) if the technology allows not to expand the infrastructure due to specialized servers with reasonable damage to quality, the infrastructure does not expand

3) the security subsystem must functionally cover the entire infrastructure and take into account every detail and nuance of the business logic to the detriment of universality

4) inter-cluster data replication and supporting for internal data clustering should be at the application level for maximum performance, stability and control

5) data is managed by those who form it and in most cases it is a frontend and database, so the backend does not know anything about business logic

6) ... still thought through
